que.1- You are an employer in a company which have a web application for which you have to develop a calculator.Write a program to design a calculator in which you have to give some scientific function like comparing two numbers and find the smaller and greater one as well. 
Ans:
def calc(a, b): 
    if(a>b):
        print("a is greater")
        print("b is smaller")
    else: 
        print("b is greater")
        print("a is smaller")
calc(10,30)     
Output: b is greater 
               a is smaller
Imp:Inorder to achieve the solution we need to use comparison operator '>' it helps to find larger and smaller one. 
que.2- One girl named as Chandni, have to write a paragraph but by mistake she wrote some letters in upper case  and some in lower case. Now she wants to arrange them in a grammatical manner as capital letter after every specific symbol like comma, full stop, etc. and rest in lower case. Write a program to help her out. 
Ans:
Imp:we can achieve this problem by using title function in Python it allows us to set all the data in a structured format like it translates every first letter into capital all rest of the letters to lowercase in every single individual word. 
For example:
Given paragraph :
parag="now a dAyS          technology makes US laZy" 
Strupara=Parag.title()
print(Strupara) 
Output:Now A Days Technology Makes Us Lazy 

que.3- You are an employer in a company, HR gives you a task  to mail a document. You want to find one word and  also count how many times it came in document.
             {HINT-assume the data as a paragraph of your choice.} 
Ans:
Let us consider an example. 
doc="This documentary mainly about upcoming live sessions provided by XYZ company.this sessions mainly deals with python programming and after that the sessions closed with simple projects." 
cont=doc.count("sessions") 
print("the count is", cont) 
Output : the count is 3

que.4- There is a girl wants to write autobiography of her  favorite player. She writes a paragraph for that but missed some words. Now help her to add those words.
              {HINT-use format of string function and                                                       data(autobiography)of your choice.} 
Ans:
Here is the matter:" hello my name is and am from from". Here i forget to give my name and place now i can solve my problem by using string format function. 
str= "hello my name is {} and am from {}" 
name="Lavanya" 
place="Andhra Pradesh" 
out=str.format(name,place) 
print(out) 
Output:hello my name is Lavanya and am from Andhra pradesh 

que.5- Explain standard data types in detail with example.
Answer: python is loosely typed language. Therefore no need to mention datatype of variables.

Tuples 
2.mutable 
Lists 
Sets

Examples:
   a=10
   Str="hello world" 
   Tup=(15,8,"hi",'hello',5.6)
   Lst=["Lavanya",19,'A. P']
   Set={'A', 'E', 'I','O','U',5}
Dict={'name':'abhi','age' :13}
